### Dark & Light Mode 🌗

`Skills Icons` now supports automatic theme detection — icons will seamlessly adapt to your system’s dark 🌙 or light ☀️ mode without any parameters or manual setup.

This behavior is powered by `CSS` built-in media query `prefers-color-scheme`, which detects the user’s current theme preference and adjusts the SVG colors accordingly.
